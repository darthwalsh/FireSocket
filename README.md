# FireSocket

A drop-in replacement for WebSocket using [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).

## Example

A full example showing dynamically switching between FireSocket and WebSocket is in [example/](example/).

### Code changes

TODO(example) example snippet

TODO(example) example code showing where to plugin public/secret firebase config

### Firebase setup

- Create [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) project
- Set up [Database](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/firesocket-test/database) in locked mode
- Set up [Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/firesocket-test/authentication)
  - Enable Anonymous, and/or another provider to allow for resumption of socket connection
- Set up [Admin Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/start#admin-sdk-authentication) using a [Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#overview)
  - Open [IAM Service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
  - Suggested name "server"
  - Give permission "Firebase Realtime Database Admin"
  - TODO can use application default credentials?
  - (MAYBE only for local testing) Create a JSON key and [store it securely](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#managing_service_account_keys)
- Set up database security rules
  - Run `firebase login` then `firebase init` 
  - In `firebase.json` change `database.rules` path to `node_modules/firesocket/database.rules.json`
  - TODO verify this works
  - Run `firebase deploy --only database`
- TODO links have firesocket-test?

### App setup

- On the web server, change `WebSocket` to `FireSocket`
  - `require("firesocket")`
  - (TODO split up browser part) If clients are browser-based, use `firesocket.Server.createFromCreds` factory to create Server.
  - The returned `FireSocket.Server` object is compatible with `WebSocket.Server`
- Download the client public config for web app
  - https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592
  - The web server is expected to serve this JSON at `/firebase-config.json`
- Add the `firesocket.js` script before your web app's logic
  - Replace `WebSocket` with `FireSocket` (the constructor args are ignored)
  - The `FireSocket` object is compatible with `WebSocket`

## Roadmap to release 1.0

  - https://medium.com/@Philmod/npm-release-automation-adb970e49066
- firebase disconnect messages [using onDisconnect](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/offline-capabilities#how-ondisconnect-works)
- Any TODOs left in README
- Any TODOs left in code, maybe won't fix

## Future improvements

- [ ] Authentication is pluggable, so app can swap in email/SMS/OAuth sign-in
- [ ] [Generate type declarations](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/32372) instead of relying on cast to WebSocket 

## Testing

Like normal, run `npm test` to run all tests. This includes unit tests, and mock tests using the firebase emulator and a local WebSocket server. See [spec/](spec/README.md) for more information.

The [example/](example/) can be useful for manually debugging changes.

## Motivation for client-server communication

### WebSocket
The default client-server communication, and by far the fastest. It's pretty simple for a [web game](https://github.com/darthwalsh/Austerity/blob/3bd2cfb825eaf8d537945c02da5b96bfe38ddca7/server/connection.js) to just update state and issue questions based on player events.

Downsides:

* Cheap hosting servers don't allow many simultaneous connections, if any
* Messages are not persisted, so a server reboot will wipe out any app state

### Firebase Database

Using [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), it is possible to emulate WebSocket messages. 

This fixes both limitations:

* Firebase is free for [100 connections users](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/), with pay-as-you-go up to 200k.
* When the server restarts it can event-source state from the database

Realtime Database was picked over Firestore because the average round trip latency of 600ms is fast enough to barely be noticed by users, while Firestore is noticeably slower at 1500ms.

#### Database Schema

Each game is composed of string or object messages from server to client, and v/v.

Each firebase client listens for `child_added` on their message queue.

Here, user* is a userID from Firebase Authentication

    user:
        userWQ3mVT:
            0: Message: Connected to Game
            1: Choice: New Game, Refresh
            2: Message: Cards
            3: Choice: Play Copper, Buy Copper
        user7f8pR:
            0: Message: Connected to Game
            1: Choice: New Game, Refresh, alice's game
    server:
        userWQ3mVT:
            0: Name: alice
            1: Choice: New Game
            2: Start: Militia, Moat, ...
        user7f8pR:
            0: Name: bob
            1: Choice: Refresh

As an implementation detail, when first connecting, the client sends the current date with key __CONNECTION,
and then the server sends the same date on its stream. This way the client can know an active server is listening.
